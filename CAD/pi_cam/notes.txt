Pi 4 dimensions:

Needs approx 2.1mm below board
Total stack height 20mm (bottom of ethernet pegs to top of USB3 jack)

Height of current mount from top of plate to top of camera bracket is
78mm. Height of camera bracket is 84mm.  It might be possible to fit
if we make the housing standoffs stick up into the baseplate, and make
cutouts for other interferences.

But distance sideways is 95mm, so may make more sense to put the cards
on edge, power connector up, spaced out sideways.  This solves the
problem of the power connectors being cramped and inaccessible.  Then
arrange airflow upward, air plenum under the plate.

Mount on rPi crosswise allthread with unthreaded plastic spacers?
Nice if we could assemble the stack and then drop it in

Allow 2mm extra space, then:
    22 * 4 = 88
    95 - 88 = 7

 1.6 * 4 = 6.4
 (95 - 6.4 - 5)/4 = 20.9

If we use 20mm spacer on top, then we have 8.6mm left over This needs
to be made up somehow by odd length spacers at the ends, or spreading
it out.  The long thru rod length is about 112mm.  We need enough room
on the bottom side for the nut on the non-thru rod.
