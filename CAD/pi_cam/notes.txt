Inspecting camera mount angles w/ sine plate:
4x1 16mm portrait:
    Bottom: 23.048 degrees, 1.958 = 0.108 + 0.150 + 0.700 + 1 
    Top: 7.6828 degrees, 0.668 = 0.108 + 0.160 + 0.400

If the mount is warped so that the front rocks on the surface, then
you need to include the rocking in the worst case TIR.

If we measure the deviation over 22mm, then 0.001"/25um is 1.14
mrad. I'm seeing deviations of .007 TIR or less, so 8 mrad. 

For 16mm lens, the pixel angle is 96 urad. 8 mrad corresponds to 83
pixels which is an acceptable deviation so far as maintaining the
image overlap with the 250 pixel nominal overlap (neglecting other
contributors such as camera/lens off-axis).

The effect of pointing error is of course worse with longer lenses.

Having problems with image overlap changing during the day, perhaps
especially when cold.  What amount of mechanical change do we need to
cause this pointing error?

I don't have solid numbers, but let's say 10 pixels.

14.3 degrees FOV:
>> 14.3 / 4056 * pi / 180  ==> 6.1534e-05 (rad/pixel) or 615 urad

So 610 urad for 10 pixels

If I measure 12.5 um over 3cm, then that is:
>> 12.5e-6/3e-2 => 0.00041667 or 417 urad

This is very much in the same ballpark.  The baseline is pretty
uncertain since what we really have is bowing, and not clear what part
to measure.  Ideally would measure at the camera mount plane,
currently measuring at the front center of the camera mount vs. 3
point support near the edges (on the back).

Pi 4 dimensions:

Needs approx 2.1mm below board
Total stack height 20mm (bottom of ethernet pegs to top of USB3 jack)

Height of current mount from top of plate to top of camera bracket is
78mm. Height of camera bracket is 84mm.  It might be possible to fit
if we make the housing standoffs stick up into the baseplate, and make
cutouts for other interferences.

But distance sideways is 95mm, so may make more sense to put the cards
on edge, power connector up, spaced out sideways.  This solves the
problem of the power connectors being cramped and inaccessible.  Then
arrange airflow upward, air plenum under the plate.

Mount on rPi crosswise allthread with unthreaded plastic spacers?
Nice if we could assemble the stack and then drop it in

Allow 2mm extra space, then:
    22 * 4 = 88
    95 - 88 = 7

 1.6 * 4 = 6.4
 (95 - 6.4 - 5)/4 = 20.9

If we use 20mm spacer on top, then we have 8.6mm left over This needs
to be made up somehow by odd length spacers at the ends, or spreading
it out.  The long thru rod length is about 112mm.  We need enough room
on the bottom side for the nut on the non-thru rod.
