RPI SETUP

- install raspbian (download from https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
  [NOTE: Arducam may require a specific patched distribution]
- update and upgrade
	> sudo apt-get update
	> sudo apt-get upgrade
- remove GUI (allow to reboot)
	> sudo raspi-config
	> sudo reboot
- git clone https://github.com/robmacl/breathecam.git
- cd to rpi code tree
     	> cd breathecam/Code/pi_cam
- config_files/breathecam.ini to set "camera_id"
- install remote access, TBD, save ID for remote connection
- launch breathecam on boot
	> sudo crontab -e	(add following to the bottom)
		@reboot /home/breathecam/breathecam/Code/pi_cam/run_all.sh
- reboot and test
	> sudo reboot


Currently running with VNC not started and startup to command prompt.
You can run the GUI from the console command line by:
    startx

It is possible that the GUI may be competing with the camera image
capture for kernel DMA memory.  I've seen failures to allocate DMA
"cma" memory.


VNC access:

ssh to pi
See breathecam/Code/pi_cam/start_vnc script, has the below.

    # start headless VNC
    vncserver-virtual

If no taskbar/pi menu in the VNC:
    export DISPLAY=':1'
    # Start window manager
    startlxde-pi
    # optional start terminal directly
    lxterminal &

Window manager not starting may have to do with VNC not being enabled
at startup in pi config.  So by starting another server (it seems on
display :0) this works better.  This explicit start creates the
taskbar, but the window manager features of resizing windows is not
started (and no window borders).


TODO:

 -- Remote access software
 -- Procedure for camera preview (aiming and framing) in the field
 -- Procedure for focus setting (use ROI)
 -- Arducam camera mux support
