Maybe log to a single file, and use append mode.  Not clear we really need to
save old logs as opposed to appending.  Either way the space grows without
bound.

If things are consistently not working then a reboot might help.  This had
formerly been done by takeImage.py exiting and then the launched rebooting
after a number of fails.  imageService.py will exit if it gets an exception,
but it presses on if we get a timeout or the file does not appear.
 ==> Possibly this could be in a seperate watchdog process
